  <!-- Climate -->
  <section id="climate">
    <h2>Climate</h2>
    <p>
      Deserts are known for having the lowest precipitation out of any biome, usually receiving less than 
      10 inches (25 cm) of rain per year. Temperatures can reach over 120°F (49°C) during the day 
      and drop below 40°F (4°C) at night. Dust storms, droughts, and long dry seasons create a 
      surprisingly active climate.
    </p>

    <p>
      The extreme heat shapes the ecosystem by limiting plant growth, pushing animals to evolve nocturnal 
      habits, and creating unique survival strategies. Seasonal temperatures shift dramatically, with summers 
      being extremely hot and winters being cool and dry.
    </p>
    <p>
  Not all deserts are hot. There are also cold deserts, such as the Gobi Desert in Asia. 
  These deserts experience freezing temperatures, snow, and icy winds, but they still receive very little 
  precipitation, which is what makes them a desert. This shows that deserts are defined more by dryness 
  than heat.
</p>

<p>
  Desert climates are strongly shaped by high-pressure systems. These systems push away 
  clouds, which is why deserts have clear skies for most of the year. Clear skies allow 
  sunlight to heat the ground quickly in the day, but also allow heat to escape fast at night, causing 
  extreme temperature swings.
</p>

  <!-- Plants -->
  <section id="plants">
    <h2>Plants</h2>
    <p>
      Desert plants survive extreme heat by conserving water and preventing evaporation. Many have shallow, 
      wide roots to absorb water quickly, while others store water inside thick stems.
    </p>

        <p>
  Many desert plants grow extremely slowly because they need to save energy and water. Some species, 
  like the saguaro cactus, can live over 150 years. Their slow growth helps them survive 
  drought conditions that would kill other plants.
</p>

<p>
  Some plants only bloom after rare rainfall events. These are called 
  ephemeral plants. They stay as seeds for months or even years, waiting for a rainstorm. 
  After rain, they sprout, grow, flower, and spread seeds within just a few days.

  <!-- Animals -->
  <section id="animals">
    <h2>Animals</h2>
    <p>
      Desert animals survive through burrowing, nocturnal behavior, and water-saving adaptations. Many obtain 
      water through the food they eat rather than drinking directly.
    </p>

        <p>
  Most desert animals are nocturnal, meaning they come out only at night. This helps them avoid 
  the heat and conserve water. Some animals, like kangaroo rats, never drink water at all, they get all the 
  moisture they need through seeds.
</p>

<p>
  Desert predators such as hawks, snakes, and foxes play a huge role in controlling population sizes. 
  Without predators, herbivores would eat too many plants, which could damage the entire food web.

    <h2>Food Web & Energy Pyramid</h2>

    <p>
      The desert food web is built on producers like cacti and shrubs. Herbivores such as insects and small 
      mammals feed on these plants, while predators like hawks, foxes, and reptiles form the higher levels.
    </p>

    <img class="foodweb-img" src="https://www.sciencefacts.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Desert-Food-Web.jpg" alt="Desert food web">

    <h3>Energy Pyramid</h3>
    <img class="foodweb-img" src="https://taigajhorstman.weebly.com/uploads/5/1/5/1/51516581/3119105_orig.jpg" alt="Energy pyramid">
    <p>
  Interactions in the desert are extremely delicate. Because water is so limited, even small changes—like 
  introducing a new species or removing a predator—can disrupt the entire ecosystem. For example, if the 
  number of rodents increases too much, plants may not be able to recover, leading to erosion and habitat 
  loss.
</p>

<p>
  Many animals have mutualistic relationships. One example is how birds help clean 
  parasites off larger animals like camels. In return, the birds get food and protection. 
  These relationships help species survive harsh conditions.

  <!-- Geography -->
  <section id="geography">
    <h2>Geography</h2>
    <p>
      Deserts cover about 20% of Earth’s land. Famous deserts include the Sahara (Africa), Arabian Desert 
      (Middle East), and the Mojave (United States). These regions contain sand dunes, rocky plateaus, 
      mountain ranges, and dry riverbeds known as wadis.
    </p>

    <img class="map-img" src="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/img/biome/map-desert.jpg" alt="Desert biome world map">
    <p>
  Some deserts formed millions of years ago due to rain shadows. This happens when moist air 
  rises over a mountain range, cools, and drops its moisture on one side. The other side receives almost 
  no rain, creating dry desert conditions. The Mojave Desert and Atacama Desert both formed this way.
</p>

<p>
  Desert landscapes change constantly. Wind moves sand dunes across the land, sometimes shifting them 
  several feet per year. Flash floods, although rare, are powerful enough to carve canyons and shape new 
  landforms in a matter of hours.
</p>
